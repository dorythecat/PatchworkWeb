# PatchworkWeb
This is the repository for [Patchwork Lab's](https://www.patchworklabs.org/) website proposal.

This site is built entirely using pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. No frameworks or libraries
have been involved, since I like to keep things under control, so I can ensure they are lightweight
and efficient.
