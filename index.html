    <div>
        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <p>Cakes, right? Or was it muffins? I'm really not sure actually, this is just a test page</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>How we do it</h2>
        <p>It might involve a cat, a piece of gum, and a really big orange. I don't really know. This is just a test page.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>When we do it</h2>
        <p>Probably Saturday. What Saturday? I don't know, this is really just a test page...</p>
        </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Why we do it</h2>
        <p>Cake is tasty! Well, and muffins too! But this is just a test page so I don't have neither :(</p>
    </div>

<section class="showcase">
    <h1>Showcase 2</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Why trust us</h2>
        <p>Ok, first of all, meanie. Why wouldn't you trust us? Second, this is a test page so like, there's nothing to fear.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>How to get involved</h2>
        <p>Get an oven and... Oh no wait I've just been informed we don't actually do cakes, because this is just a test page. :(</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>What do we do, then?</h2>
        <p>Probably muffins? Why did we need the cat, again? Also can I eat the piece of gum? I just wanna test it out, like this page!</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>What about the orange?</h2>
        <p>Oh! I almost forgot! I sat over it and it disappeared so I don't really know about that... Then again, this is just a test page...</p>
